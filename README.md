## About Me
Hello there!
 
My Name is Alexandra Bierkamp, and I was the previous Executive Assistant supporting the Vice President of the Origination Processing stream within Rocket Mortgage Technology. My journey with the FOC started in December 2020 as an Administrative Assistant, and in September 2021, I was promoted to Executive Assistant. I have spent the past 16 months dedicated to progressing in my career and have been on track to move into a Special Projects Manager role in Q3 2023.
 
Over the past few years, I have been fortunate to work with an impactful Senior Leadership group and assistant community that have encouraged my growth and development. On top of the administrative duties I carry out, such as calendar and email management, I have been contributing to high-level projects and taking on greater responsibilities outside of my scope. I strive to live out a "yes before no" attitude each and every day, both at work and in my personal life.

## Project Highlights
### Risk Management
Challenge accepted!

When my executive leader first asked me to get involved with risk management, I never imagined it would become something I'm so passionate about now. I quickly got up to speed by meeting with a Senior Enterprise Risk Specialist and received a throughout walkthrough of the ServiceNow issue procedure. Risk Management quickly became one of my routine responsibilities, and I have made it a priority to follow through on the remediation of my team's issues. I consistently reviewed the issue backlog to keep myself and my executive updated on the remediation progress. I organized meetings with each of my Directors and issue owners to review the issues assigned to their teams and complete the following tasks:
c
- Assign myself as the point person/project manager for the stream to manage the communication of all issues on the team
- Partner with the teams to create an action plan and validate the issue
- Update the ServiceNow issue record and provide consistent updates to stakeholders until the issue has been resolved

- For example, I took the conn on ensuring the remediation of a GLBA-related issue. I consistently communicated with team members, leaders, and issue managers and provided the necessary updates to the action plan and activity in ServiceNow. I made it a priority to ensure everyone had the necessary awareness on our progress to remediate the issue. We began with 28 open issues in our backlog and at the time of my departure, we were sitting at 3 in the backlog that were all on track to be remediated by the given deadline.

### The Bridge
The Bridge is a technology-wide roadmap at the enterprise level that is composed of the most critical initiatives among each technology team. This project was a primary focus for me starting in Q4 2022 and throughout all of 2023. I worked closely with my executive leader, our Directors, and the lead Special Projects Manager to document our team's progress and ensure we are on track.

I proactively teamed up with the lead SPM to learn about her responsibilities, walk through process flows, and identify areas to get involved. Together, we collaborated on the communication of the project, assigned exercises and action items, and created an efficient change management process. We conducted a headcount and skillset exercise around each team's core product on the roadmap. The purpose of this exercise was to help the team make trade-off decisions as new work comes through. For the change management process, we created a form and aligned on a set list of essential questions for the teams to answer that would help provide clarity and visibility into why changes needed to be made to the roadmap.

### The Fawkes Project
#### Quality Automation
The overall goal of the project was to migrate all documents from our current platform to a new platform. This has been a critical initiative for one of the teams under my executive leader's organization, and I made it a priority to partner with the Director and teams leading the initiative to stay connected to the project and ensure my leader was up to date. I collaborated with Director, the former project manager and key team members to develop and roll out the quality automation roadmap. I organized several meetings to determine the key initiatives and milestones and align on achievable target dates for the project as well as the necessary work items associated with each initiative. After achieving alignment with the group, I created a successful high-level roadmap that outlined those key initiatives and milestones to share with our stakeholders.

### DevBuild Cohort 7
DevBuild is a full-time technology training program available to team members across the enterprise intended to help with the development of skills required to become a successful Software Engineer. Upon the completion of the program, participants are placed on engineering teams that raised their hand to take on a new engineer. At the start of 2022, I partnered with the lead Special Projects Manager and two program managers to help roll out the newest cohort. We met frequently to discuss the project and communication plan and ensure a successful placement of graduates. This was such a valuable experience as I was able to connect with many new team members across the company and build new relationships. 

### Rocket Mortgage Technology Team Leader Onboarding Guide
Looking beyond to recognize opportunities plays a key role in the continuous improvement of teams and a company. Onboarding is crucial when it comes to setting a team member up for success in their role. While creating an onboarding guide for the team members on my specific team, I noticed there was a lack of documentation for Team Leaders going through the onboarding process. I had an idea to create a document to help get our newest Team Leaders across technology up to speed on best practices, training, resources, point of contacts, the hiring process, and more. 
After recognizing the need for this documentation, then came the execution. I partnered with two peers outside of my team to determine what information should be included and how best to communicate this new resource. Together we connected with several Team Leaders across technology to collect feedback for this document. We identified key information new Team Leaders should know and presented the document to the Technology Executive Team. After a successful presentation and approval from the executive leaders, we rolled it out to Team Leaders across all of the technology business area. 

## Additional Contributions
### Operational Review
I partnered with my team's SRE Senior Team Leader to collect and interpret technical metrics at our team's level every month. I took the conn to create a dashboard in ADS that displays metrics around the Post Incident Process (PIP) for technology incidents including the current backlog of open work items related to incident reports, work items marked done or removed, work items without target dates, and the length and time of work items in each state. I proactively reached out to Product Owners on any open work items to get them prioritized and completed in order to help prevent future technology incidents. We also source date to report on the following:
- Total technology incidents per month
- Total incident reports completed per month
- Average Time to Detect (TTD)
- Average Time to Resolve (TTR)
- Deployment Metrics
- Code Coverage
- AWS Spend
- Capacity Bucket Data
  
### Pull Requests
I began getting involved with SRE teams at the start of 2022 and jumped in to help with system uptime. In order to decrease the number of outstanding incident reports across technology, I performed bi-weekly audits in GitHub to ensure work was being done to merge them. I also held teams accountable if they were not prioritizing them. At the beginning of the year, there were close to 200 open pull requests in the repository and our goal was to get that number down to only those was were open 30 days or less. At the time of my departure, we had achieved that goal and I am confident my role made a significant impact.

### Monthly Newsletters
Since January 2021, I consistently partnered with Product Owners and Senior Leadership to gather updates on the work each team was doing to highlight their accomplishments. The newsletter helped provide the needed visibility to our stakeholders into the work being done on each team. I received positive feedback on these newsletters from the CTO and helped inspire other teams and business areas to create one for their organizations. 

### Event Management
In addition to planning team onsites, event planning played a huge role in my responsibilities. Myself and a few peers formed a fun team to create fun and exciting activities for our technology teams. Together we organized several events and activities to create a fun working environment and encourage collaboration across our teams. Some of the events we organized include a Halloween costume and pumpkin carving contest, Star Wars Day trivia and costume contest, and a Stream Olympics. 

### SharePoint
I became a subject matter expert for my teams when it comes to all things SharePoint. I created a stream-level site for my organization and helped stand up sites for all of the teams my Directors lead. I designed the sites to be user-friendly and modern and serve as a central hub for essential resources. 

### .NET Training Curriculum 
I was heavily involved in my team's Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and collaborated with my executive leader, Directors, and top engineers to set the training curriculum associated with one of our objectives up for success. This curriculum was intended for team members that were interested in learning .NET. I took on several tasks such as creating detailed and informative SharePoint pages, an email distribution for the group managing the objective, the registration process, progress tracking progress, and the organization of the kick-off meeting. I helped lead this project to deliver a successful roll out and participant experience and ensure the objective was on track.
